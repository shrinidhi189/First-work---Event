            <li><h2>Conferences</h2></li>
            A conference is typically a large-scale event that revolves around a central theme, topic, or industry. They are often held over multiple days‚Äîthree on average, according to American Express‚Äîand include special activities, guest speakers, exhibitions, and networking opportunities.<br>This type of special event is a great way to achieve a swarm of potential business goals, such as brand awareness, lead generation, and thought leadership. Conferences are unique in that they can serve all of these goals simultaneously, depending on the contents and activities that take place. In short, they help attendees learn about, interact with, and understand your business and its brand.

            <li><h2>Trade Shows</h2></li>
            A trade show invites many different companies of a specific industry to showcase their products and services to the general public. The focus of a trade show is to exhibit the latest products to your target audience and generate brand interest. By allowing your target audience to interact with your brand, you have the chance to create memorable experiences and leave a lasting impression.<br>This event type can be a small, simple event with just a few vendors, or it can include thousands of businesses exhibiting in the same venue. Either way, trade shows are a great way to increase brand awareness, build contact lists, and generate sales pipeline‚Äîa key metric that 94% of event organizers use to measure success, according to Markletic.
            <li><h2>Workshops</h2></li>
            Workshops offer a ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù alternative to sitting in an event space listening to a guest speaker or participating in a roundtable. They‚Äôre a great way to liven up the festivities and give people a chance to learn a new skill. A workshop can be an independent event in and of itself, or it can be a complimentary event to a conference or trade show.<br>These highly interactive sessions offer attendees an educational experience. But at the same time, they can network with fellow participants and foster an interest in the skill, topic, or theme in question.
